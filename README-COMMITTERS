 ------------------------------------------------------------

The jbossws-shared-testsuite project has been removed upstream and the testsuite
copied into the jbossws-cxf stack. In order for merging changes, the following 
procedure is suggested:
1) generate a diff file in jbossws-cxf stack: 'svn diff -r rev1:rev2 > mydiff.diff'
2) move to maintenance branch of jbossws-shared-testsuite
3) move to the testsuite: 'cd testsuite'
4) patch using diff file: 'patch -p3 < /path/mydiff.diff'
